## How to study this book

Treat next/prev/random pointers as mutable graph edges. Before overwriting a reference, know whether it is your only route to the remaining suffix. Distinguish node identity from node value—cycle, intersection and deep-copy questions depend on identity.

**Required reading order:** requirement → examples → data picture → brute force → repeated-work diagnosis → invariant → optimized plan → dry run → Java → correctness → boundaries → complexity → memory trick → variations.

> **Source transparency:** topic ordering follows the retained Striver/Take U Forward study structure from this project. Extra examples, memory tricks, research notes and explanations are study-guide additions unless explicitly marked as verified from a creator/source.

## LL-1. Introduction to Singly Linked List

[Index](#navigation-and-index) · [LL-2 →](#ll-2-insertion-at-the-head-of-a-singly-linked-list)

### Detailed question understanding

**What is the problem/lesson asking?** Introduction to Singly Linked List. Rewrite the exact input state, legal operation/relationship, and requested output before choosing a technique. Similar titles often hide materially different variants—for example nearest greater versus count of all greater values, four-direction versus eight-direction grid adjacency, or node identity versus equal node values.

### Three requirement-clarifying examples

| # | Input / setup | Output / observation | Why it matters |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `smallest valid input` | `trace base state` | base/boundary semantics |
| 2 | `typical nontrivial input` | `trace expected result` | core invariant |
| 3 | `boundary-shaped input` | `verify edge behavior` | protect implementation |

### Pattern recognition

**Primary pattern:** Pointer invariant

> **KEY INTUITION —** Before overwriting a link, preserve any suffix that would otherwise become unreachable.

### Brute-force / straightforward baseline

Start with the direct simulation/repeated scan that mirrors the statement. It is valuable because it exposes **what is being recomputed**. Then ask: *what exact fact from earlier work would make the next decision immediate?*

### Optimized reasoning

Name the invariant before code. The optimized solution for this family is derived from the intuition above. Every state change must preserve the invariant; if you cannot say what the working structure means after processing the first *i* items/nodes/states, the implementation is not ready.

### Detailed dry run

Draw node objects and arrows. Before every pointer write, record the suffix/reference that would be lost if you had not saved it.

For interview practice, include at least four snapshots: initial state, first nontrivial state change, the state where the central invariant does real work, and final state. Explain **why each mutation occurred**, not merely what the values became.

### Java implementation / template

```java
// Card-specific Java implementation is expanded during the scheduled deepening pass.
// Interview discipline:
// 1) define the state/invariant,
// 2) implement exactly one valid transition,
// 3) test empty/single/duplicate/extreme cases,
// 4) use long for sums/distances when constraints can overflow int.
```

### Key line to highlight

Find the line that changes the invariant: the monotonic `while`, a graph relaxation `if`, a pointer splice, a recursive return combination, or a HashMap lookup/update. Explain what would break if its comparison or ordering changed.

### Correctness checklist

1. State the invariant before the loop/recursion.
2. Show it is true initially.
3. Show every transition preserves it.
4. Explain why the terminal state implies the requested answer.
5. For greedy algorithms, identify the exchange/cut/monotonic argument that makes the local choice safe.

### Boundary conditions

- empty/null input when the platform permits it;
- one element/node/state;
- duplicates and strict-versus-nonstrict comparisons;
- monotone/skewed/disconnected shape where relevant;
- overflow in sums, products, distances and path counts—prefer `long` when needed;
- value vs index vs node identity;
- online/streaming input versus offline preprocessing;
- repeated queries may justify preprocessing that a one-shot query does not.

### Complexity — derive it instead of memorizing it

**Finding position can be O(n); splicing a known node is O(1).**

Count how many times each element/node/edge can enter and leave the working structure, then multiply by the operation cost: array/index O(1), expected hash O(1), balanced tree/heap O(log n), full edge scan O(E).

### Memoization / repeated-work note

Memoization is useful only when the same logical state can be solved repeatedly. In many one-pass stack/list/tree problems there are no overlapping subproblems; the data structure itself stores the minimal reusable history. In graph, prefix-hash, and repeated-query problems, `visited`, `dist`, prefix maps, parent maps, or cached subtree metadata play the “do not recompute solved state” role.

> **MEMORY TRICK —** SAVE THE LINK YOU ARE ABOUT TO DESTROY.

### Interview follow-ups and variations

1. Can auxiliary space be reduced, and what invariant replaces it?
2. What changes if equality/duplicate semantics change?
3. What changes if input arrives online?
4. What changes for many repeated queries?
5. Name two related problems that reuse this invariant with only one comparison or one state dimension changed.

### Key line to highlight

Find the line that changes the invariant: the monotonic `while`, a graph relaxation `if`, a pointer splice, a recursive return combination, or a HashMap lookup/update. Explain what would break if its comparison or ordering changed.

### Correctness checklist

1. State the invariant before the loop/recursion.
2. Show it is true initially.
3. Show every transition preserves it.
4. Explain why the terminal state implies the requested answer.
5. For greedy algorithms, identify the exchange/cut/monotonic argument that makes the local choice safe.

### Boundary conditions

- empty/null input when the platform permits it;
- one element/node/state;
- duplicates and strict-versus-nonstrict comparisons;
- monotone/skewed/disconnected shape where relevant;
- overflow in sums, products, distances and path counts—prefer `long` when needed;
- value vs index vs node identity;
- online/streaming input versus offline preprocessing;
- repeated queries may justify preprocessing that a one-shot query does not.

### Complexity — derive it instead of memorizing it

**Finding position can be O(n); splicing a known node is O(1).**

Count how many times each element/node/edge can enter and leave the working structure, then multiply by the operation cost: array/index O(1), expected hash O(1), balanced tree/heap O(log n), full edge scan O(E).

### Memoization / repeated-work note

Memoization is useful only when the same logical state can be solved repeatedly. In many one-pass stack/list/tree problems there are no overlapping subproblems; the data structure itself stores the minimal reusable history. In graph, prefix-hash, and repeated-query problems, `visited`, `dist`, prefix maps, parent maps, or cached subtree metadata play the “do not recompute solved state” role.

> **MEMORY TRICK —** SAVE THE LINK YOU ARE ABOUT TO DESTROY.

### Interview follow-ups and variations

1. Can auxiliary space be reduced, and what invariant replaces it?
2. What changes if equality/duplicate semantics change?
3. What changes if input arrives online?
4. What changes for many repeated queries?
5. Name two related problems that reuse this invariant with only one comparison or one state dimension changed.

## LL-7. Insert Before Head in a Doubly Linked List

[← LL-6](#ll-6-introduction-to-doubly-linked-list) · [Index](#navigation-and-index) · [LL-8 →](#ll-8-delete-head-of-a-doubly-linked-list)

### Detailed question understanding

**What is the problem/lesson asking?** Insert Before Head in a Doubly Linked List. Rewrite the exact input state, legal operation/relationship, and requested output before choosing a technique. Similar titles often hide materially different variants—for example nearest greater versus count of all greater values, four-direction versus eight-direction grid adjacency, or node identity versus equal node values.

### Three requirement-clarifying examples

| # | Input / setup | Output / observation | Why it matters |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `smallest valid input` | `trace base state` | base/boundary semantics |
| 2 | `typical nontrivial input` | `trace expected result` | core invariant |
| 3 | `boundary-shaped input` | `verify edge behavior` | protect implementation |

### Pattern recognition

**Primary pattern:** Pointer invariant

> **KEY INTUITION —** Before overwriting a link, preserve any suffix that would otherwise become unreachable.

### Brute-force / straightforward baseline

Start with the direct simulation/repeated scan that mirrors the statement. It is valuable because it exposes **what is being recomputed**. Then ask: *what exact fact from earlier work would make the next decision immediate?*

### Optimized reasoning

Name the invariant before code. The optimized solution for this family is derived from the intuition above. Every state change must preserve the invariant; if you cannot say what the working structure means after processing the first *i* items/nodes/states, the implementation is not ready.

### Detailed dry run

Draw node objects and arrows. Before every pointer write, record the suffix/reference that would be lost if you had not saved it.

For interview practice, include at least four snapshots: initial state, first nontrivial state change, the state where the central invariant does real work, and final state. Explain **why each mutation occurred**, not merely what the values became.

### Java implementation / template

```java
// Card-specific Java implementation is expanded during the scheduled deepening pass.
// Interview discipline:
// 1) define the state/invariant,
// 2) implement exactly one valid transition,
// 3) test empty/single/duplicate/extreme cases,

Draw node objects and arrows. Before every pointer write, record the suffix/reference that would be lost if you had not saved it.

For interview practice, include at least four snapshots: initial state, first nontrivial state change, the state where the central invariant does real work, and final state. Explain **why each mutation occurred**, not merely what the values became.

### Java implementation / template

```java
// Card-specific Java implementation is expanded during the scheduled deepening pass.
// Interview discipline:
// 1) define the state/invariant,
// 2) implement exactly one valid transition,
// 3) test empty/single/duplicate/extreme cases,
// 4) use long for sums/distances when constraints can overflow int.
```

### Key line to highlight

Find the line that changes the invariant: the monotonic `while`, a graph relaxation `if`, a pointer splice, a recursive return combination, or a HashMap lookup/update. Explain what would break if its comparison or ordering changed.

### Correctness checklist

1. State the invariant before the loop/recursion.
2. Show it is true initially.
3. Show every transition preserves it.
4. Explain why the terminal state implies the requested answer.
5. For greedy algorithms, identify the exchange/cut/monotonic argument that makes the local choice safe.

### Boundary conditions

- empty/null input when the platform permits it;
- one element/node/state;
- duplicates and strict-versus-nonstrict comparisons;
- monotone/skewed/disconnected shape where relevant;
- overflow in sums, products, distances and path counts—prefer `long` when needed;
- value vs index vs node identity;
- online/streaming input versus offline preprocessing;
- repeated queries may justify preprocessing that a one-shot query does not.

### Complexity — derive it instead of memorizing it

**O(n) time; O(1) space.**

Count how many times each element/node/edge can enter and leave the working structure, then multiply by the operation cost: array/index O(1), expected hash O(1), balanced tree/heap O(log n), full edge scan O(E).

### Memoization / repeated-work note

Memoization is useful only when the same logical state can be solved repeatedly. In many one-pass stack/list/tree problems there are no overlapping subproblems; the data structure itself stores the minimal reusable history. In graph, prefix-hash, and repeated-query problems, `visited`, `dist`, prefix maps, parent maps, or cached subtree metadata play the “do not recompute solved state” role.

### Interview follow-ups and variations

1. Can auxiliary space be reduced, and what invariant replaces it?
2. What changes if equality/duplicate semantics change?
3. What changes if input arrives online?
4. What changes for many repeated queries?
5. Name two related problems that reuse this invariant with only one comparison or one state dimension changed.

### Detailed question understanding

**What is the problem/lesson asking?** Find the Starting Point of a Loop. Rewrite the exact input state, legal operation/relationship, and requested output before choosing a technique. Similar titles often hide materially different variants—for example nearest greater versus count of all greater values, four-direction versus eight-direction grid adjacency, or node identity versus equal node values.

### Three requirement-clarifying examples

| # | Input / setup | Output / observation | Why it matters |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `smallest valid input` | `trace base state` | base/boundary semantics |

| 3 | `boundary-shaped input` | `verify edge behavior` | protect implementation |

> **KEY INTUITION —** Linked lists split with slow/fast and merge by pointer splicing without array-style shifting.

### Brute-force / straightforward baseline

Start with the direct simulation/repeated scan that mirrors the statement. It is valuable because it exposes **what is being recomputed**. Then ask: *what exact fact from earlier work would make the next decision immediate?*

### Optimized reasoning

Name the invariant before code. The optimized solution for this family is derived from the intuition above. Every state change must preserve the invariant; if you cannot say what the working structure means after processing the first *i* items/nodes/states, the implementation is not ready.

### Detailed dry run

Draw node objects and arrows. Before every pointer write, record the suffix/reference that would be lost if you had not saved it.

For interview practice, include at least four snapshots: initial state, first nontrivial state change, the state where the central invariant does real work, and final state. Explain **why each mutation occurred**, not merely what the values became.

### Java implementation / template

```java
// Card-specific Java implementation is expanded during the scheduled deepening pass.
// Interview discipline:
// 1) define the state/invariant,
// 2) implement exactly one valid transition,
// 3) test empty/single/duplicate/extreme cases,
// 4) use long for sums/distances when constraints can overflow int.
```

### Key line to highlight

Find the line that changes the invariant: the monotonic `while`, a graph relaxation `if`, a pointer splice, a recursive return combination, or a HashMap lookup/update. Explain what would break if its comparison or ordering changed.

### Correctness checklist

1. State the invariant before the loop/recursion.
2. Show it is true initially.
3. Show every transition preserves it.
4. Explain why the terminal state implies the requested answer.
5. For greedy algorithms, identify the exchange/cut/monotonic argument that makes the local choice safe.

### Boundary conditions

- empty/null input when the platform permits it;
- one element/node/state;
- duplicates and strict-versus-nonstrict comparisons;
- monotone/skewed/disconnected shape where relevant;
- overflow in sums, products, distances and path counts—prefer `long` when needed;
- value vs index vs node identity;
- online/streaming input versus offline preprocessing;
- repeated queries may justify preprocessing that a one-shot query does not.

### Complexity — derive it instead of memorizing it

**O(n log n) time; O(log n) balanced recursion.**

Count how many times each element/node/edge can enter and leave the working structure, then multiply by the operation cost: array/index O(1), expected hash O(1), balanced tree/heap O(log n), full edge scan O(E).

### Memoization / repeated-work note

Memoization is useful only when the same logical state can be solved repeatedly. In many one-pass stack/list/tree problems there are no overlapping subproblems; the data structure itself stores the minimal reusable history. In graph, prefix-hash, and repeated-query problems, `visited`, `dist`, prefix maps, parent maps, or cached subtree metadata play the “do not recompute solved state” role.

> **MEMORY TRICK —** LINKED LIST SORT → MERGE SORT.

### Interview follow-ups and variations

1. Can auxiliary space be reduced, and what invariant replaces it?
2. What changes if equality/duplicate semantics change?
3. What changes if input arrives online?
4. What changes for many repeated queries?
5. Name two related problems that reuse this invariant with only one comparison or one state dimension changed.

### Detailed question understanding

**What is the problem/lesson asking?** Sort a Linked List of 0s, 1s and 2s by Changing Links. Rewrite the exact input state, legal operation/relationship, and requested output before choosing a technique. Similar titles often hide materially different variants—for example nearest greater versus count of all greater values, four-direction versus eight-direction grid adjacency, or node identity versus equal node values.

### Three requirement-clarifying examples

| # | Input / setup | Output / observation | Why it matters |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `smallest valid input` | `trace base state` | base/boundary semantics |
| 2 | `typical nontrivial input` | `trace expected result` | core invariant |
| 3 | `boundary-shaped input` | `verify edge behavior` | protect implementation |

## LL-27. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Doubly Linked List

[← LL-26](#ll-26-find-pairs-with-a-given-sum-in-a-sorted-doubly-linked-list) · [Index](#navigation-and-index) · [LL-28 →](#ll-28-reverse-nodes-in-groups-of-k)

### Detailed question understanding

**What is the problem/lesson asking?** Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Doubly Linked List. Rewrite the exact input state, legal operation/relationship, and requested output before choosing a technique. Similar titles often hide materially different variants—for example nearest greater versus count of all greater values, four-direction versus eight-direction grid adjacency, or node identity versus equal node values.

### Three requirement-clarifying examples

| # | Input / setup | Output / observation | Why it matters |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `smallest valid input` | `trace base state` | base/boundary semantics |
| 2 | `typical nontrivial input` | `trace expected result` | core invariant |
| 3 | `boundary-shaped input` | `verify edge behavior` | protect implementation |

### Pattern recognition

**Primary pattern:** Pointer invariant

> **KEY INTUITION —** Before overwriting a link, preserve any suffix that would otherwise become unreachable.

### Brute-force / straightforward baseline

Start with the direct simulation/repeated scan that mirrors the statement. It is valuable because it exposes **what is being recomputed**. Then ask: *what exact fact from earlier work would make the next decision immediate?*

### Optimized reasoning

Name the invariant before code. The optimized solution for this family is derived from the intuition above. Every state change must preserve the invariant; if you cannot say what the working structure means after processing the first *i* items/nodes/states, the implementation is not ready.

### Detailed dry run

Draw node objects and arrows. Before every pointer write, record the suffix/reference that would be lost if you had not saved it.

For interview practice, include at least four snapshots: initial state, first nontrivial state change, the state where the central invariant does real work, and final state. Explain **why each mutation occurred**, not merely what the values became.

### Java implementation / template

```java
// Card-specific Java implementation is expanded during the scheduled deepening pass.
// Interview discipline:
// 1) define the state/invariant,
// 2) implement exactly one valid transition,
// 3) test empty/single/duplicate/extreme cases,
// 4) use long for sums/distances when constraints can overflow int.
```

### Key line to highlight

Find the line that changes the invariant: the monotonic `while`, a graph relaxation `if`, a pointer splice, a recursive return combination, or a HashMap lookup/update. Explain what would break if its comparison or ordering changed.

### Correctness checklist

1. State the invariant before the loop/recursion.
2. Show it is true initially.
3. Show every transition preserves it.
4. Explain why the terminal state implies the requested answer.
5. For greedy algorithms, identify the exchange/cut/monotonic argument that makes the local choice safe.

### Boundary conditions

- empty/null input when the platform permits it;
- one element/node/state;
- duplicates and strict-versus-nonstrict comparisons;
- monotone/skewed/disconnected shape where relevant;
- overflow in sums, products, distances and path counts—prefer `long` when needed;
- value vs index vs node identity;
- online/streaming input versus offline preprocessing;
- repeated queries may justify preprocessing that a one-shot query does not.

### Complexity — derive it instead of memorizing it

**Finding position can be O(n); splicing a known node is O(1).**

Count how many times each element/node/edge can enter and leave the working structure, then multiply by the operation cost: array/index O(1), expected hash O(1), balanced tree/heap O(log n), full edge scan O(E).

### Memoization / repeated-work note

Memoization is useful only when the same logical state can be solved repeatedly. In many one-pass stack/list/tree problems there are no overlapping subproblems; the data structure itself stores the minimal reusable history. In graph, prefix-hash, and repeated-query problems, `visited`, `dist`, prefix maps, parent maps, or cached subtree metadata play the “do not recompute solved state” role.

> **MEMORY TRICK —** SAVE THE LINK YOU ARE ABOUT TO DESTROY.

### Interview follow-ups and variations

1. Can auxiliary space be reduced, and what invariant replaces it?
2. What changes if equality/duplicate semantics change?
3. What changes if input arrives online?
4. What changes for many repeated queries?
5. Name two related problems that reuse this invariant with only one comparison or one state dimension changed.
